Neural Nets
-----------
Thanks for buy TongFramework's Neural Nets. This framework will help to make intelligent behaviour in
different forms, each adapted to the way you need. You can learn more about neural networks reading 
the Bibilgraphy PDF, but its not needed to use this framework.

Neural Nets its an aritifical intelligence technique that allows to create a neuron structure where
each neuron its connected with others in the network. That internconected neurons net can learn 
any behaviour you want through trainings. This trainings adapt the neural net to answer you the 
desired value. To give data to the neural net we have input neurons when we can give to that neurons
values between 0 and 1. Finally after all the needed process the neural net returns an answet through
the output neurons, where you can collect also values between 0 and 1. The quantity of inputs and
outputs its defined by the developer, and also the developer can define the hidden neurons. The hidden
neurons are the neurons that process the data, if theres a lot, the result will be more accurate but
the calculation will take more capu cycles, so try to keep in a reasonable number. The number can be
determined in base of how much inputs and outputs you have and also by the quantity of variations that
the behaviour of the net can have.

To train the network we give to the net various examples of how the output should be with a certain
input and train that examples a lot of times to the net remember.

We have prepared 3 examples of use of the features of the framework, the first its an introduction of
the framework and neural nets concept and its uses scripts of the framework to do a pre start training
giving all the train cases, the second explains how to dinamically train the net in case of wrong 
output and finally the third example explains how to save and load the neural net in a file.
